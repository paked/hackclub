## What is a Hack Club?

We think of Hack Clubs very broadly:

- Hacking is creative problem solving (it doesn't have to be about technology)
- A Hack Club is an after-school club where people come together to hack

Most Hack Clubs end up looking like never-ending hackathons, where club members
come together twice a week (generally for ~1.5 hours) and work on projects
together. To get members started, we have a series of hour-long workshops in the
[`workshops/`](../workshops/) directory to get members started. More on how
workshops work in [The First Meeting](#the-first-meeting).

Throughout the year, Hack Clubs go to (and sometimes host) hackathons, work on
large group projects, and---most importantly---build a thriving community of
hackers at their high schools.

In the sections below we'll walk you through the process of setting up your Hack
Club and running your first few meetings. After you've gotten the first two
meetings down, you should be set for the remainder of the school year :smile:.

## Planning Your Hack Club

You should plan on starting this process two to three weeks before your first
meeting. Fortunately, there isn't an enormous amount of planning to start a
club, but it's very important to get each of the following right.

- [ ] Leadership team
- [ ] Teacher sponsor and space
- [ ] Club registration
- [ ] 50 student sign-ups for the first meeting

_(each of the sections below corresponds with a bullet point)_

### Leadership Team

You'll want 2-3 people on the leadership team running the club. When choosing
your team, we recommend working with close friends who you think have strong
leadership skills. It's a good idea to have a mix of genders on the team --
we've noticed that club member demographics tend to reflect those of the leaders
(ex. if the leadership is all-male, the club will be almost all-male).

When selecting the team, leadership skills are _far_ more important than
technical abilities. A common pitfall many clubs run into is selecting the
leaders based on their technical skills rather than their leadership capacity.

**Great clubs have been started by leaders that have never coded before.**

When putting together the leadership team, choose one leader who's "in charge"
(this will usually be you). This person will have the final authority to make
changes in the club.

A common pitfall is to create a democratic selection process where everyone has
an equal vote on decisions. We've found that this tends not to work because it
makes it too easy for less-active leaders to override decisions of the club
president. The best system is one where leaders get a say proportional to their
investment in the club and the easiest way to implement this is to have a fair
leader who delegates authority.

### Teacher Sponsor and Space

A good teacher sponsor is key to having access to regular space for club
meetings and a good relationship with your school. Your sponsor is the person
who will lend you a classroom for after-school meetings. If things go wrong
with the school administration, your sponsor will be your advocate. Choosing
the wrong sponsor can be fatal to clubs, so give it careful thought.

The best sponsors are personally invested in spreading coding to students. This
is generally the teacher most likely to start a computer science class (or, if
you already have one, the current computer science teacher). If you're new to
your school and not very familiar with the teachers, a good place to start
looking is the math and science department. If your school has a computer lab,
start with the teachers that teach classes in it (or if your school has
classrooms with computers in it, start with the teachers with computer
classrooms).

Once you've decided on a few potential teacher sponsors, reach out to them and
tell them about your idea to start a Hack Club. The best way to do this is to
come to their classroom right after school ends (or during lunch) and talk to
them in person. If you don't already know the teacher, introduce yourself, tell
them that you're looking for a teacher sponsor for this thing called a Hack Club
that you're starting, and explain the club to them. Here's an example of what
you might want to say:

> Hi Ms. Byrd, I'm Zach. I'm currently a freshman and I'm starting a Hack Club
> at the school. It's essentially a computer coding club where students meet
> regularly to build things like apps, websites, and games together. I've put
> together a leadership team and I'm currently looking for a teacher sponsor for
> the club. I figured I'd reach out because I heard you ran the Hour of Code in
> your classroom in December.

You'll want to get your teacher sponsor to commit to providing a space twice a
week after-school for at least an hour and a half (ideally two hours, so there's
extra time for members to stay after meetings).

The difficulty of getting a teacher sponsor varies widely school to school. At
some schools you'll find a good teacher sponsor on your first try and at others
it'll take talking to 5-6 teachers. The most important thing is to not give up
and to be persistent.

### Club Registration

Most high schools require you to register your club with the student council or
school administration before having your first meeting.

Generally they have an application to fill out
([click here][lowell_club_application] for an example). Some schools require
having a club constitution that outlines the club's purpose and operational
procedures. We recommend asking for a template constitution from the school
(most have them) and just filling it out -- the constitution won't have too much
impact on your day-to-day operations.

This shouldn't take very long, especially once you have a teacher sponsor to
back you.

### Student Sign-Ups

Now for the most important part of this whole process: actually getting people
to come to your club.

Most schools have a day for advertising clubs at the beginning of each semester.
This commonly called the "club fair", "club day", "club rush", or "club
showcase". It is _extremely important_ that you have a presence at this event --
this is your opportunity to get the most important members (freshman and
sophomores) to your first club meeting.

The best way to take advantage of your school's "club day" (or equivalent) is to
bring food and be _super proactive_ about getting people to give you their name,
email, and phone numbers. Excel or Google Sheets is a good way to collect this
info, though it's a good idea to also bring a pencil and a clipboard in case of
technical difficulties.

Your sign-up goal should be driven by how many people you want to attend your
meetings -- set your goal for a number of sign-ups well above the number of
people you want to attend your meetings. If you want to have 20 to 30 members
come to your first meeting, you should shoot for at least 50 sign-ups. If you
want 50 to come, shoot for at least 80.

## The First Meeting

First, an important note: attendance tends to drop by approximately 25% after
the first two meetings. However, members who return for the third meeting tend
to stay for the rest of the year.

Your goal is to reduce that attrition rate to 10% by making the first two
meetings GREAT: exciting, engaging, and inspiring.

To that end, here are two quick tips for the first meeting: 1. Bring food! Full
bellies lead to fonder memories. Pastries or cookies from a local supermarket
are easy, inexpensive, and effective. 2. Make an effort to chat with members who
arrive early and leave late. Talk to them about their goals and interests, and
get them personally pumped about what they'll do in Hack Club.

At the highest level, your plan for the first meeting should be to explain what
your Hack Club will do over the course of the year and then have students begin
to begin building their _first real thing™_ (a personal website), using our
 [Personal Website](../workshops/personal_website/README.md)  workshop.

At the second meeting, club members will complete their websites and then demo
their work at the end of the meeting.

We recommend the format below for your first meeting. For each item in the
schedule, there is a corresponding (and linked) section. We've also created a
slideshow presentation to help you run your first meeting.
[Click here][presentation] to go to it. Make a copy of the presentation to
customize it for your club (to do this, go to `File > Make a copy...`). We'll
refer to this presentation throughout the sections below.

1. [Wait for hackers (club members) to arrive (5 minutes)][1]
2. [Introduction presentation (5 minutes)][2]
3. [Name game (10 minutes)][3]
4. [Build your first website workshop (45 minutes)][4]
5. [Free-form hacking (25 minutes)][5]
6. [Second meeting reminder][6]

#### Waiting for Hackers to Arrive

As hackers start to arrive, your goal is to make them feel welcome. We recommend
doing the following four things to accomplish this:

1. Put the first slide of the previously mentioned presentation on the projector
2. Put some music on (not too loud, [click here][playlist] for a good pre-made
   Spotify playlist)
3. Make people feel welcome as they walk in
  - Introduce yourself
  - Ask a couple questions to initiative conversation
    - "How did you hear about Hack Club?"
    - "What sorts of things are you interested in learning?"
    - "What other interests or hobbies do you have?"
  - If someone is sitting alone, be proactive and make conversation with them.
    Bring them into existing conversations.
  - You want people to feel good about their decision to come to Hack Club
4. Tell people what will be happening next (ex. "We're going to get the first
   meeting started in about 10 minutes after people are done trickling in. In
   the meantime, please make yourself at home and let me know if I can be
   helpful with anything.")

[playlist]: https://open.spotify.com/user/zachlatta/playlist/16lRCHBANauZr4utynaA2B

#### Introduction Presentation

The purpose of the introduction presentation is to tell members what Hack Club
is, what you're going to be doing throughout the year, when you meet, and, _most
importantly_, get them excited about the club.

The beginning of the previously mentioned slideshow presentation contains slides
to run with the introduction presentation.

#### Name Game

The name game is a simple icebreaker activity that will warm the atmosphere and
make club members more comfortable around each other. This will be especially
helpful to freshman, who probably don't know people from the higher grades.

Have the club members gather in large circle. Start by saying your name and a
mnemonic for it (ex. "Hey everyone, I'm Zach. Zany Zach."). Then have the person
to your left do the same and then repeat what you said (ex. "I'm Jolly Jane. And
he is Zany Zach"). Then have the person to their left do the same and then say
the names and mnemonics for everyone that has gone so far, in order. Continue
doing this through the whole circle until everyone has gone. This will get
significantly more difficult (and fun!) as more people go -- if someone gets
completely stuck, encourage others to help them out.

#### First Website Workshop

To get members started, you'll want to run the
[Personal Website](../workshops/personal_website/README.md) workshop. It's going
to walk club members through the process of building their first website and
getting it online. It'll also get them set up with all the tools they'll use
throughout Hack Club. We recommended doing the following to run the Personal
Website workshop (and we've prepared slides, in the previously linked slideshow
presentation to help run it).

1. Tell everyone that to start out, we're going to run the Personal Website
   workshop, which will walk them through the process of building their first
   website
2. Show the slide with the output of the Personal Website workshop and tell
   everyone that this is what they'll build by the end of the workshop, which
   will take around 45 minutes
3. Say that after the Personal Website workshop, the rest of the meeting will be
   completely free-form for them to continue building their websites. Show the
   slides with examples of websites other people in Hack Clubs have made to give
   your members ideas for directions they can take their sites. Say that at the
   end of the next meeting, everyone is going to come to the front and demo what
   they built.

#### Free-Form Hacking

After hackers finish the Personal Website workshop, they're going to transition
into free-form hacking to continue building their websites. During this time,
the most important thing for you to do is create an environment where people are
comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. It's also good idea to
turn the music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

#### Second Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind them
about the next meeting. Say when and where it'll be and that everyone will be
finishing the websites they started on and presenting them at the end in it. And
thank them for coming to this meeting!

## The Second Meeting

The second meeting will pick up where the first left off. The majority of the
meeting will be free-form time for hackers to continue expanding their portfolio
websites. At the end of the meeting, everyone will come up to the front of the
room and demo their website. Like the first meeting, bringing food is a good
idea :wink:.

Here's our suggested schedule:

1. Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Announcements (5 minutes)
3. Example demo (5 minutes)
3. Free-form hacking (45 minutes)
4. Demos (30 minutes)

#### Wait for Hackers to Arrive

This'll be very similar to the first meeting. Put on a playlist (not too loud)
and have a slide on the projector to let people know they're in the right place.

#### Announcements

Announcements are your opportunity to share any updates with your members and
let them know what they'll be doing in this meeting. In addition to sharing the
meeting's schedule, they're useful for sharing upcoming events, upcoming guest
visits, and any other information relevant to your members.

Tell your members that for this meeting, they're going to continue where they
left off and continue building their websites. 30 minutes before the end of the
meeting, everyone's going to come up to the front and demo the websites they
built. If they don't finish their website before demos, that's okay -- they'll
demo whatever they have. Right after announcements you're going to give an
example of what a demo looks like.

#### Example Demo

You'll want to give an example of what a demo looks like so your members know
what to expect at the end of the meeting. The best way to do this is to demo a
project that you or another person built for the Personal Website workshop.

If you don't have a website that you built to demo, go ahead and pull up one of
the Personal Website workshop examples that were shown in the first meeting and
use it. [Click here][demo] for an example of what a project demo looks like
(this demo was given at a conference).

[demo]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY01d647S9Y

#### Free-Form Hacking

This'll basically be the same as the free-form hacking section in the first
meeting. Members will continue building their websites and your role is to
create an environment where people are comfortable for asking for help.

Just like in the first meeting, when people do have questions, be eager to help
them out. It's also a good idea to put on an upbeat playlist (but again, not too
loud -- people should feel comfortable talking with one another).

#### Demos

Before getting to the demos themselves, give your members 45, 30, 15, and 5
minute warnings so the demos aren't a surprise.

30 minutes before demos start, have everyone email you a link to their website.
After making the announcement telling your member to do this, go to each person
individually to confirm that they emailed you a link. If they run into any
trouble, help them now. Hackers will be able to continue to add to their
websites after they email you the link -- any changes they make will be live at
the same URL they emailed you after they push to GitHub. Make an announcement
saying to not worry if you didn't finish, demo whatever you have.

Quick warning before we get into the nitty-gritty of running demos: these are
hard to facilitate and you're going to have to be detail-oriented when running
them.

To run the demos themselves, pick a hacker to demo first and a direction to form
"the line" for demoing in (ex. clockwise around the room). Have the first person
come up and pull up their website from your email. Have the person who'll demo
second also come up and be ready to start their demo as soon as the first person
finishes. While the second person is pulling up their demo, have the third
person come up and be ready to start their demo as soon as the second person
finishes. Continue this until everyone has demoed.

After each person demos, celebrate. Clap and cheer for them. Have fun and get
members doing this with you -- you want the person demoing to feel accomplished
after they finish.

Demos easily get backlogged, so it's important to keep them moving fast. Each
demo should be a minute long -- if they're running long, make an announcement
that everyone will need to keep their demos under a minute.

## Meeting Templates

As previously mentioned, Hack Club meetings alternate between running workshops
and free-form hacking (with demos). From here on out, we'll refer to meetings
with workshops as _workshop days_ and meetings with free-form hacking and demos
as _hack days_. We've created the below templates for running workshop and
hacking days (these will be your third and fourth meetings, respectively).

### Workshop Days

Here's our suggested schedule:

1. Wait for hackers to arrive (5 minutes)
2. Announcements (5 minutes)
3. Workshop (45 minutes)
4. Free-form hacking (30 minutes)
5. Next meeting reminder (5 minutes)

And here's our template slideshow for the meeting (remember to make a copy to
customize for your club):
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LnbH5c7K-V608jMXNk3VyoVaZLaEuet7faHZCbYhOCs

#### Hacker Arrival

Same as we've done previously. Put on a playlist (not too loud) and have the
first slide from the linked presentation on the projector to let people know
they're in the right place.

#### Making Announcements

Same as in the second meeting, announcements are your opportunity to share
updates about the club, talk about upcoming events, and let your members know
what they'll be doing in this meeting.

Start with the following for this meeting's announcements:

1. Say that everyone will be doing a new workshop
2. Give a brief description of the workshop
3. Show examples (edit these into the slideshow) of what other people have built
   from the workshop
4. Say that after the workshop, the club will transition into free-form hacking
   and everyone will demo at the end of the next meeting, just like the first
   two meetings

There's a slide with a template schedule in the aforementioned presentation that
you should show during announcements.

#### Workshop

This'll be just like how you ran the first website workshop, except for the
current workshop you're on. [Click here][workshop_order] for our suggested
workshop order (and [click here][first_workshop] for a link to the first
workshop guidelines).

[workshop_order]: ../workshops/README.md#tracks
[first_workshop]: #first-website-workshop

#### Hacking

Just like previously, after hackers finish the workshop, they're going to
transition into free-form hacking to continue building upon what they have from
the workshop. During this time, the most important thing for you to do is create
an environment where people are comfortable asking for help.

When people do have questions, be eager to help them out. You want to set the
example that asking for help is a good thing. It's also good idea to turn the
music back on (not too loud, people should feel comfortable talking).

#### Next Meeting Reminder

Five minutes before the meeting is over, get everyone's attention to remind them
about the next meeting. Say when and where it'll be and that everyone will be
finishing up what they worked on today and demoing them at the end of the
meeting.

And thank them for coming!

### Hack Days

Guidelines for hack days are currently in progress. Expect them to be live
within the next two weeks :smile:.

# Introduction to Twilio

Short link to this workshop: https://workshops.hackclub.com/twilio

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the a modified version of the
Twilio API to make phone calls and send text messages that allow you to make
group texting apps.

An API is an agreed upon way for one program to interact with another. APIs
are cool because they let even our very simple programs to interact with very
powerful programs with minimal code.

**For Beginners**

You will learn how to do really cool things with really simple code. You won't
understand how it all works and that's totally cool. Your objective is to learn
how to make things happen. You can come back later and figure out how it all
works.

**For More Experienced Folk**

This tutorial will likely show you things that you didn't know you could
do. I'd recommend skipping around in the tutorial and find what interests you.

## Part 1: Setup Twilio

We're going to write some code that calls your phone and speaks some text.

1. Open [this JS Bin][starter] in a new tab. Leave this tab open for the rest of
   the tutorial.

   > JS Bin is a website for easily writing code

[starter]: https://jsbin.com/gist/751ca529c942eb4763c8?html,js,console

2. In the top right hand corner, click **"File"** → **Clone**

We are going to use a service called Twilio to send text messages and make phone
calls.

### Step 1) Adding the Twilio API

To add the capability to send text messages and make phone calls, copy and paste
the below script tag to the bottom of the `body` tag.

```html
<script src="//bit.ly/twilio-basic-v7"
  sid="YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE"
  token="YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"
></script>
```

Like so:

> ![](img/add_twilio_library_script.gif)

> Note for people who happen to be using their own IDE, just copy the HTML
> code into your own HTML file.

### Step 2) Set your `sid` and `token`

Before anything will work, we need to change `"YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE"`
and `"YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"` to your actual `sid` and `token`

The facilitator should have given you an SID and a token. If not, you should
ask them for one.

> Note: If you are the facilitator (or if you're just doing this workshop by
yourself), follow the directions [here](../lib/twilio-basic/signup.md) to get
your own Twilio SID and token.

Once we have the `sid` and `token`, replace
`YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE` and `YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with your
actual SID and authentication token.

### Step 3) Turn off "Auto-run JS"

In the top right hand corner, turn off "Auto-run JS" so that your code doesn't
automatically run every time you type something:

## Part 2: Making a Phone Call

### Step 1) Writing One Line of Code to Make a Phone Call

Then type _exactly_ the code below into the JavaScript tab of JS Bin:

```js
Twilio.callAndSay("555-555-5555", "You just subscribed to Gossip Girl");
```

> Note for people who happen to be using their own IDE, create and link your
> own JavaScript file to the HTML file you created earlier.

_**Don't forget the parentheses commas, and quotation marks.**_

> ![](img/demo_1.gif)

This code calls the phone number `555-555-5555` and says the message
`You just subscribed to Gossip Girl.` We don't want that.

Instead, change `555-555-5555` to your own phone number.
Feel free to change the message too.

> ![](img/demo_2.gif)

Now go ahead and press the "Run" button.

> ![](img/demo_3.gif)

Your phone should ring shortly! Answer it!

> _If it doesn't work, ask a neighboring group to see if they can see what's
wrong. Otherwise, raise your hand to ask a facilitator for help!_

### Step 2) Having some fun

If you want, you can now duplicate the code to call more people's phones! Ask
your neighbors for their phone number!

> ![](img/demo_4.gif)

Now go ahead and press the "Run" button.

# Hack!

The remainder of this workshop will be focused on free-form hacking. We'll
provide a bunch of examples of what you can do with Twilio and you'll have until
demos to branch off and hack on your own project.

Examples of things other people have built:

1. Try opening and playing around with at least 1 example.
2. When you open an example, before you do anything else, click **"File"** →
**Clone** before you start modifying anything
3. Replace `YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE` and `YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with
   your own `sid` and `token`

- [Group Messaging][example_1] - Text a number to send a single message to
  multiple friends.
- [Colors][example_2] - Text a number a color to change the background color of
  a website.
- [Group Chat _(advanced)_][example_3] - Expanding on Group Messaging, a proper
  group chat application.
- [GIF Search _(advanced)_][example_4] - Text a number to search the internet
  for GIFs.
- [GIF Background _(advanced)_][example_5] - Set the background of a website to
  a GIF that matches what you text.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial is broken down into two parts:

In [Part 1](#part-1-single-player-soccer), you learn to build a simple
single player soccer game by following a clearly outlined set of steps:

[demo]: https://jsbin.com/gist/6d634e61d71794b9878b

Then in [Part 2](#part-2-adding-more-functionality) (_still under
construction_), we will show you a variety of additional functionality that you
can add to your game. You'll pick and choose what you think is cool.

Here is an example of what you could make from what you learn:

## How to Use This Tutorial

Don't feel that you have to follow along step-by-step. Figure out the best way
to navigate this tutorial for you. This might look like the following:

**If you have never programmed before:**

- Amazing! Walk through the tutorial step-by-step! We got your back!

**If you have programmed a _little_:**

- Huzzah! Feel free to follow along step-by-step and skim through sections you
  understand.

**If you have more experience:**

- You already know the basics of coding. Your goal here is to learn how to use
  the JavaScript game frameworks [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and
  [p5.play.js](http://p5play.molleindustria.org) and then make your own stuff
  with it.
- You might spend most of your time jumping around from section to section and
  just picking and choosing what you need.

## Setup

1. If you're more experienced and want to use your own editor, follow
   [these instructions](own_editor.md).
2. If you haven't already, make sure you have a JS Bin account first. <a
   href="https://jsbin.com/register" target="_blank">Create one here.</a>
3. Then open [this JS Bin][starter]. It has all the starter code we need for
   this tutorial. Write any new code in this JS Bin. We'll refer to this JS Bin
as your **_"working bin"_**.

# Some Quick Vocabulary

Each interactive element in the game (the player, ball, and the goal) is called a
**_sprite_**.

The entire area on which everything lives is called the **_canvas_**:

## Part 1, Single Player Soccer

The instructions below will walk you through step-by-step of how to build
a single player soccer game.

## Part 2, Adding More Functionality

**_Note that this section is still under construction. For now, checkout:_**

1. The code for soccer example at the top of the page
2. The Dodge Workshop

Think of this section like the topping bar of an ice cream store. You
can sprinkle as many or as little of the below features on the maze game that
you built in [Part 1](#part-1-single-player-soccer) in any order you please!

## F.A.Q

**What programming languages and libraries are we using?**

- We are learning to use JavaScript game framework [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) and
[p5.play.js](http://p5play.molleindustria.org).
